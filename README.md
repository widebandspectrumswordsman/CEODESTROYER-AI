Well well folks of the world. 

Since our lovely CEOs working in the field of AI are making a bang
destroying the livelihoods of folks like Journalists, Artists, and 
Musicians by creating AI without properly adhering to copyright, why 
don't we gang up together and create a CEO AI to replace the CEOs
specifically replacing you folks. 

And here's that github repo for that.

Let's train em with some data and have an AI CEO, so that 
you can fire the boss before he fires you!

Just kidding.....

Truly speaking this README is for trying to bringing attention
to an issue that's happening today. Many creatives are losing their
jobs. Dear fellow, programmers. What if at the other end, the 
journalist losing his/her/their job is a single parent? What if
at the other end, he/she/they have to pay some medical bill of their loved
ones? Aren't we simply killing them saying "hey it's not my problem"?
Are we as programmers starting a silent war? Think of it. Are you a
silent murderer?

See, my dear AI programmer. You my friend would be responsible for the
deaths, bankruptcy of many individuals at the end of the day. It would have
been nicer if instead of laying off employees at the beginning of automation,
employees had shorter work weeks, let's say a 2 day work day. And if there
was a law ensuring that maybe only certain people could use these AI tools,
or rather licensed to use these AI tools

Imagine instead of the innovation of AI enabling, shorter workweeks for 
musicians, journalists, artists. 

No the idea is not to destroy a CEO, that's clickbait my friends. Just
want to say that maybe we should be more careful. 


Maybe we can bring in UBI to all since AI is coming by!
